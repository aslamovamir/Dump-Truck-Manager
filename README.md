# Dump-Truck-Manager
A Windows Forms App written in C# in .NET framework. The app is designed to manage the loading of 20 trucks with ore with the help of the loader. The loader picks random amount of ore each time, between 0 and 10 tons, and loads onto the trucks one at a time. The app manages the loading of the trucks and ensures the max amount of ore in each truck is 496 tons. The app displays a very clear UI showing precisely east step of the whole process, showing the status, tracking the number of trucks loaded, the amount of ore the loader happens to pick, the current amount of ore in each truck and finally the total amount of ore loaded in all the trucks overall. The program uses the Thread to pause the program execution to account for loading.
